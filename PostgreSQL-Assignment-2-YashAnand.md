What is RDBMS?

In an RDBMS or Relational Database Management System, the data is organised into tables with rows and columns - like it is done in a spreadsheet. The data entered in a row of the table would be associated with its respective column's header, making the data more structured and tidy. The main component of an RDBMS therefore consists of its capability of inputting data as tables and also allowing data interaction and management based on the relationship between the tables. 

In order to better explain this, let's take an example of a 'Soft-Drink refrigerator' as the one that has been displayed below.

Lets assume that the manager of the store that this fridge is set up in, wishes to efficiently manage information related to the various soft drinks such as:
- Name of all the soft-drink brands
- Details related to supplier of the soft-drinks

In order to do so, he could utilise an RDBMS to help him store and manage data in the form of various tables. This could be done by creating one table called "Brand_Names" and another called "Supplier_Details", and populating the related data into these tables. However, in order to check which supplier is in charge of supplying a specific soft-drink, a relation could be easily formed between the 2 tables for relating different brands with their suppliers, in the following way:
